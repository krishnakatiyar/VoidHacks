/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for NeuroScribe AI.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, where doctors can only access their own profiles and the patient records they create.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /doctors/{doctorId}: Stores doctor profiles. The `doctorId` MUST match the Firebase Auth UID.
 * - /doctors/{doctorId}/patient_records/{recordId}: Stores patient records associated with a specific doctor. The `doctorId` in the path MUST match the `doctorId` field within the document.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Doctors can only read and write their own profiles.
 * - Doctors can only read and write patient records that they own.
 * - Listing of all doctors is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `PatientRecord` entity contains a `doctorId` field that MUST match the `doctorId` in the path. This denormalization avoids costly `get()` calls in the security rules, improving performance and security.
